A completely fictional data platform used to start and experiemnt with different design patterns when building data platform.

The backbone of this platform will be Kubernetes, a local single cluster.

Please be aware that these are not using 'production grade' deployments with multiple region deployments, key rotation, security enhancements etc with each service or set of services. This repository is meant to be for educational use to understand techniques to maintaing and building a platform that enables 12 factor application design, event-driven design principles and as such compromises have been taken. These will be highlighted as such.

If you do not want to use kubernetes, simply just use the docker compose files to run the services you want to use.
